MewNotch is a macOS app that enhances the functionality of the notch on new MacBooks by displaying volume and brightness changes, replacing the default system HUD with a modern and seamless experience.

## Features

- **Volume Display** - Shows volume changes directly on the notch.
- **Brightness Display** - Displays brightness adjustments in real-time.
- **Minimal & Non-Intrusive** - A clean, lightweight alternative to the default system HUD.
- **SwiftUI-based UI** - Smooth animations and modern macOS styling.

## Installation

2. Move the app to the Applications folder.
3. Run the app and grant necessary permissions if prompted.

> I don't have an Apple Developer account yet, so the application will display a popup on the first launch. 
>
> Click Okay, then navigate to **Settings > Privacy & Security**, scroll down, and click **Open Anyway**. 
> 
> This only needs to be done once.

## Usage

1. Launch **MewNotch**.
