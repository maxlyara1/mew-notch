- **Sound Device** - Shows current input/output device on notch, when changed.
- **Power State** - Show current power source as well as left time on battery when available.
- **Now Playing** -  Control now playing media directly from notch. Expand notch for additional controls.
- **Minimal & Non-Intrusive** - A clean, lightweight alternative to the default system HUD.
- **Heavily Customizable** - Each HUD can be customised to have different styling.
- **SwiftUI-based UI** - Smooth animations and modern macOS styling.

> I don't have an Apple Developer account yet, so the application will display a popup on the first launch.

> Click Okay, then navigate to **Settings > Privacy & Security**, scroll down, and click **Open Anyway**. 
> 
> This only needs to be done once.

## Usage

1. Launch **MewNotch**.
2. Re-launch to open settings, if required. Notch won't appear at first launch on non-notched devices.
